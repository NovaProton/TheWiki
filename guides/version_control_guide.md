# Version Control Guide

This guide outlines the standards we follow for version control to ensure smooth collaboration, code integrity, and effective tracking of changes across our projects. Adhering to these practices will help streamline development and maintain quality.

## General Principles

1. **Commit Often**: Make small, frequent commits that reflect logical changes. This makes it easier to track the history and identify where things went wrong.
2. **Write Descriptive Commit Messages**: Use clear and informative messages to describe what the commit does. Avoid generic messages like "fixed issue".
3. **Use Branches**: Create separate branches for features, bug fixes, and experiments. Always work in a feature branch rather than directly on the `main` or `master` branch.
4. **Pull Request Reviews**: Every pull request should be reviewed by at least one other developer to ensure code quality and share knowledge.

## Branching Strategy

1. **Main Branch**: The `main` branch should always be stable and contain production-ready code. All new code should be merged here only after being thoroughly tested.
2. **Feature Branches**: Each feature or enhancement should have its own branch, named descriptively (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`).
3. **Bug Fix Branches**: Use branches for fixing issues, with names such as `bugfix/login-error`.
4. **Release Branches**: Use release branches to stabilize code for a particular release. This helps in managing bug fixes that need to be made before deploying.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Test Regularly**: Testing should be an ongoing process. Before pushing changes, run all relevant unit tests to ensure no new issues have been introduced. Automated testing can be particularly useful in spotting regressions.
2. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Make use of CI tools to automate testing for every commit or pull request. This ensures that issues are caught early in the development process.
3. **Test on Feature Branches**: Each feature branch should be thoroughly tested before merging into the `main` branch. Unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests should be carried out as appropriate.
4. **Code Reviews**: Code should not only be tested but also reviewed. Another team member should review each pull request before it is merged, focusing on both code quality and testing coverage.

## Commit Guidelines

1. **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should have a single purpose. Avoid combining multiple logical changes into a single commit.
2. **Message Format**:
   - **Title**: Keep it under 50 characters, describing what has been changed.
   - **Description**: Provide more context if necessary, especially for complex changes. Include the reason for the change and any impact it might have.

   Added JWT-based authentication to the login module. This helps enhance security and provides token-based access for users.

## Merging

1. **Rebase vs Merge**: Rebase feature branches before merging to keep a clean and linear commit history. Avoid rebasing shared branches to prevent conflicts.
2. **Merge Commit Messages**: When merging a branch, ensure the merge commit has a meaningful message summarizing the branchâ€™s purpose.
3. **No Direct Commits to Main**: All changes to `main` should come via pull requests. Direct commits are discouraged to maintain stability.

## Tagging and Releases

1. **Version Tags**: Use tags to mark specific releases (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`). This helps in identifying stable points in the history.
2. **Semantic Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). Increment:
   - **MAJOR**: For incompatible API changes.
   - **MINOR**: For backwards-compatible features.
   - **PATCH**: For backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## Best Practices for Collaboration

1. **Sync Often**: Regularly sync your branch with `main` to avoid diverging too far and making merge conflicts more difficult to handle.
2. **Resolve Conflicts Early**: Address merge conflicts as soon as they arise. The longer they are left unresolved, the more challenging they can become.
3. **Communicate**: Keep your team informed of the status of your branches and any blockers or issues you're encountering.

## Tools and Integration

1. **Git Hooks**: Use Git hooks for automated checks before commits or pushes, such as linting or running basic tests.
2. **Continuous Integration**: Integrate tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Travis CI to run tests and checks automatically.
3. **Code Quality Tools**: Include tools like SonarQube or Code Climate in your workflow to ensure high code quality and consistency.
