# Documentation Standards Guide

This guide outlines our standards for creating and maintaining documentation in our projects. Clear and consistent documentation is crucial for the ease of onboarding, collaboration, and future reference.

## General Principles

1. **Clarity**: Documentation should be clear and concise, avoiding jargon whenever possible.
2. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology, formatting, and structure across all documentation.
3. **Up-to-Date**: Regularly review and update documentation to reflect any changes in the project.
4. **Audience Awareness**: Tailor the level of detail and complexity to suit the intended audience, whether they are developers, end-users, or stakeholders.

## Types of Documentation

1. **Code Documentation**: Includes inline comments, function headers, and API documentation.
2. **User Guides**: Instructions aimed at end-users to help them understand how to use the software.
3. **Developer Guides**: Documentation focused on helping developers understand the architecture, setup process, and contributing guidelines.
4. **Technical Specifications**: Detailed documents that outline the system architecture, components, and interfaces.

## Structure and Format

1. **Headings**: Use descriptive headings to break the content into manageable sections.
   - Start with a main heading (`#`), and use subheadings (`##`, `###`) for nested content.
2. **Lists**: Use bullet points (`-`) for unordered lists and numbers (`1.`) for ordered lists to present information clearly.
3. **Code Blocks**: Use fenced code blocks (` ` ) to include code examples, and specify the language for syntax highlighting.
   ````markdown
   ```cpp
   // Example of code snippet
   int main() {
       return 0;
   }
   ````
   ```
   ```
4. **Links**: Provide relevant hyperlinks to additional resources or related documentation.
5. **Tables**: Use tables to present structured information in a readable format.

## Style Guidelines

1. **Language**: Use simple, direct language. Avoid overly technical terms unless necessary.
2. **Tone**: Be formal yet friendly. Use the second person (e.g., "you can") to engage readers directly.
3. **Abbreviations**: Define abbreviations the first time they are used. For example: "Application Programming Interface (API)".
4. **Formatting**:
   - Use **bold** for important terms and *italics* for emphasis.
   - Highlight file names, commands, or keywords using backticks (e.g., `main.cpp`).

## Writing API Documentation

1. **Function Descriptions**: Describe each function's purpose, inputs, outputs, and potential errors.
   ```cpp
   /**
    * @brief Fetches data from the server.
    *
    * @param url The server endpoint to fetch data from.
    * @return JSON data as a string.
    * @throws NetworkException if the server is unreachable.
    */
   std::string fetchData(const std::string& url);
   ```
2. **Parameter Documentation**: Clearly document the purpose of each parameter, including type and valid values.
3. **Error Handling**: Document any exceptions or error codes that can be returned.

## User Guides

1. **Introduction**: Start with a brief introduction explaining the software, its purpose, and the target audience.
2. **Installation Instructions**: Provide clear, step-by-step installation instructions. Include system requirements and any prerequisites.
3. **Usage Examples**: Offer practical examples to illustrate how to use the software's features.
4. **FAQs**: Include a Frequently Asked Questions section to address common issues and queries.

## Developer Guides

1. **Project Overview**: Provide a high-level overview of the project, including goals, major features, and key technologies.
2. **Setup Instructions**: Detail the steps required to set up the development environment. Include any dependencies and commands.
3. **Contributing**: Outline contribution guidelines, including coding standards, branch naming conventions, and the pull request process.
4. **Architecture Diagram**: Include diagrams to represent the system architecture, module relationships, or data flows.

## Maintenance

1. **Version Control**: Link documentation to the relevant code version or release. Clearly indicate which version the documentation refers to.
2. **Changelog**: Maintain a changelog for significant updates to the software or documentation.
3. **Review Cycle**: Set a regular schedule to review and update documentation (e.g., every quarter or after each major release).
